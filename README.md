# hello-world
just a demo repository

很早以前就想着用Github来整理一些研究成果了，
但是，全英文的网页直接就把我给劝返了。
趁着这次疫情在家咸鱼，论文工作也暂时告一段落的机会，突发奇想
来学下Github的操作。
也不知道能在这个平台坚持多久，但是我尽可能争取就选定这个平台作为我的主力好了。
毕竟很多互联网大厂也把自己开源项目传到了这个网站上，
所以我觉得这个平台近10多年应该是倒不了的吧。
那么就从今天开始，来探索程序猿之路吧！

A long time ago, I thought about using Github to organize some research results.
However, the English-language webpage directly advised me.
Taking advantage of the outbreak of salted fish at home, the thesis work also temporarily came to an end, a sudden whim
Let's learn Github.
I don't know how long I can stay on this platform, but I try to choose this platform as my main force.
After all, many big Internet companies have also transmitted their open source projects to this website.
So I think this platform should not be able to fail for more than 10 years.
So start today, and explore the path of the program ape!
